## Update BmlipTeachingTools.jl
This package is still in development, and new features are added regularly. To use new features from the package (which you might see in the documentation), you need to **update the version of BmlipTeachingTools used in the notebook**. To see how to do this, check out the Pluto docs:

https://plutojl.org/en/docs/packages/#updating-packages



## Development
This package is being developed alongside the development of course materials for https://github.com/bmlip/course. The package uses SemVer version numbering, so you can already use this package for your own course.
